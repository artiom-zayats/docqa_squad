Most things are out of reach for her. Jeannie, a Labrador retriever, acts as her arms and legs. Jeannie understands 72 or more different commands. On a shopping trip, she can get money for Lee Ann at the bank or candies at the store. She can pay the cashier   and get change back. Jeannie brings things to Lee Ann and puts them in her lap.\nJeannie was trained at a place called Canine Companions for Independence, located on twelve acres of land in Santa Rosa (California). The land was donated   by the cartoonist Charles Shultz. \"We train four different types of dogs here,\" said Ken Kirsh, a dog trainer there. \"Hearing dogs, service dogs, skilled companion dogs, and facility dogs.\"\nTrainers work with Labrador retrievers and golden retrievers for hours a day, but not every dog is good enough to be a working dog.\nThe work is a serious business. Hearing dogs warn their owners of sounds like ringing telephones and doorbells. Other dogs work with disabled patients like eight-year-old Noah Habib who communicates with a special computer. He likes it when people come to ask him about his dog. His father says, \"People are really interested in the dog and will come over and ask to pet her and play with her, and ask about what she does, and these are people that normally might not approach us and want to talk to Noah.\"\nWhen Lee Ann Laraway comes home with Jeannie and her goods, Jeannie helps her open the door. \"You can train a dog to do a lot of things.\" said Lee Ann."}], "title": "No Title"}]}
